# UNRELEASED
* Nothing... yet

# 0.5.0 - 2021/04/19

* Fixed branch name detection when in detached head state.

# 0.4.3 - 2021/02/03
## Data-collector
* Fixed a bug in the formatting of log output that was causing logs to be incompatible with Elastic Common Schema. When a value could not be determined, a default of '-' was used, which is incompatible with some fields. Now optional fields with no value are not included in log output.

# 0.4.2 - 2021/02/01
## Data-collector
* Fixed a bug in the formatting of log output that was causing logs to be incompatible with Elastic Common Schema. The `source.address` field contained an ip address:port pair, when it should have just been an IP address.

## Report Parser
* Fixed a bug in how NIST NVD data is pulled that meant data after 2020 would not be pulled because of a hardcoded year

# 0.4.0 - 2021/01/06
## Data Collector
* Fixed the format of ECS formatted log data to correctly use nested objects
## Report Parser

## CLI
* KILN_SCAN_ENV environment variable is read by CLI to tell Data Forwarder what environment scan is running in

# 0.3.2 - 2020/10/27
## CLI
* Fixed an issue in the path mapping feature introduced in 0.3.1 that would fail to correctly map the path supplied with `--work-dir` to a path inside a container running the CLI in certain circumstances, caused by a bug in the version of the Bollard crate that was being used.

# 0.3.1 - 2020/10/09
## CLI
* Fixed an issue that would cause the CLI to fail to read kiln.toml if run in a docker container and the `--work-dir=path/to/directory` option was used.

# 0.3.0 - 2020/10/07
## CLI
* Added support for overriding the directory to scan with tools with the `--work-dir=path/to/directory` option. This defaults to the current directory if unspecified. Relative and absolute paths are supported.

# 0.2.1 - 2020/09/21
## Report-parser

* Added support for customising the URL used to fetch NIST NVD data to support mirroring
* Added Elastic Common Schema compatible JSON logging output

## Slack-connector
* Replace `Kafka` crate with `rdkafka`
