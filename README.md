# Kiln
![](https://github.com/simplybusiness/kiln/workflows/CI/badge.svg)

Kiln is a collection of dockerised application security tools, with some special sauce to collect the output and send it to an Apache Kafka cluster. This data can then be analysed and used to perform Slack notification, raise items on a team's backlog, or determine trends in security findings, among other things.
