Kiln is a collection of dockerised application security tools, a validating HTTP proxy to forward the tool output to an Apache Kafka cluster and a collection of connectors to consume data from the Apache Kafka cluster and perform tasks like Slack notifications, raising items on a team's backlog, or determine trends in security findings.

The main goal of Kiln is to make security tools easy for teams to adopt while also gathering useful data for a security team.

## Architecture
Kiln is architected as a modular, event sourcing system with only two required components: the Kiln Data Collector and an Apache Kafka cluster. When you run a Kiln Security Scanner, the tool output is send to the data-collector, which acts as a data validation point and HTTP interface to the Apache Kafka cluster. The data-collector then inserts the tool output and some additional metadata into a Kafka topic. For an introduction to Event Sourcing, checkout https://dev.to/barryosull/event-sourcing-what-it-is-and-why-its-awesome.

All Kiln Connectors are Kafka consumers that process the events in the tool output topic and respond accordingly. For example, the Slack connector can consume events as they're added to the topic, compare the application name to a list of applications it knows about and send a message to the appropriate Slack channel with new security findings.

Kiln Security Scanners are docker containers with security tools baked into the image and also include a small binary that takes the output from the tool and sends it to the Kiln Data Collector to be recorded.

## Trying Kiln out for yourself

If you're interested in trying Kiln out, there is a [Quickstart](docs/quickstart/README.md) guide which walks you through deploying a Kubernetes cluster to AWS and then deploying Kiln to that cluster. Once you have Kiln deployed, there is also a [data analysis guide](docs/data-analysis/README.md) which walks you through setting up JupyterHub and analysing data generated by Kiln to answer the question: Given several projects, what is their average time to remediate a vulnerability in a dependency present in their Master branch.

## Versioning
Kiln follows [SemVer 2.0](https://semver.org/) for versioning and all components are versioned in lockstep.

Our Docker images follow this naming convention:

| /        | Master                                     | Release                             |
| ---      | -------                                    | ---------                           |
| Tool     | kiln/tool-name:master-GIT_SHA-TOOL_VERSION | kiln/tool-name:GIT_TAG-TOOL_VERSION |
| Not Tool | kiln/component-name:master-GIT_SHA         | kiln/component-name:GIT_TAG         |

The kiln/tool-name:master-latest, kiln/component-name:master-latest, kiln/tool-name:latest and kiln/component-name:latest are updated to point at the most recently published image for that channel.
